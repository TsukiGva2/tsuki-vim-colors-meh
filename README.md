# vim-colors-meh

> A 256-color / 24-bit Vim color scheme, with preference for contrast over hues.

It works for me, just publishing it in case someone has similar taste and
wants to use it.

## Some of my design choices

- The background is not fully black to be easier on the eyes.
- Comments are greyed-out and italicized
- Returns are orange for easy scanning when you use early-return pattern
- Booleans, `super`, `this`, and constants stand out
- Strings are in blue since that is the color people most likely ignore
- Text is slightly brown, and everything else is a contrasted
